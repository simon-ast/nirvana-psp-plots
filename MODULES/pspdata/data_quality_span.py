As Dr. Livi pointed out, EFLUX peaks should be below 150째 (or 30째 from
the heat shield) to be confident about a full distribution.

PSEUDOCODE:
Take the argmax of EFLUX_VS_PHI
    - 8 entries per measurement
    - Output will be between 0 and 7

Correlate the output as index for Theta value (can be hardcoded)
    - Drop all measurements where the index is <= 1 (maybe 2?)
    - 0 and 1 correspond to ~175 and ~160째, 2 would be almost 150째

Add measurements from SPAN-I to the data base

PSEUDOCODE:
For encounter_folder
	for each file in spc_folder
		generate and reduce data frame
		export encounter_data_frame
	for each file in span_folder
		generate and reduce data frame
		export encounter_data_frame
	
	Concatenate spc and span data frames
		Need individual instrument indicators
	
	Log number of data points indiviually, as well as the total
		Plot data point number separate for SPC and SPAN-Ix
	
After this, the rest of the routine should be the same as before.
